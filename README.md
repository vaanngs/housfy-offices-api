    <h1>Microservice Housfy's Offices API</h1>
    This repository is an example of a PHP microservice API using Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles keeping the 
    code as simple as possible. 
  <br />
  <br />
</p>

## 🚀 Environment Setup
  Stack used: <br />
  - <strong>Framework:</strong> PhpSlim <br/>
  - <strong>Language:</strong> PHP 7.4 <br/>
  - <strong>Database:</strong> Mariadb <br/>
  - <strong>Cache:</strong> Redis <br/>
  - <strong>Queues:</strong> RabbitMQ <br/>
  - <strong>Unit testing:</strong> PHPUnit <br/>
  - <strong>Functional testing:</strong> Codeception <br/>
  - <strong>Infrastructure:</strong> Docker with Docker compose <br/>

### 🐳 Needed tools

1. [Install Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
2. Clone this project: `git@github.com:vaanngs/housfy-offices-api.git`
3. Move to the project folder: `cd housfy-offices-api`

### 🛠️ Environment configuration

1. Create a local environment file (`cp .env .env.dist`)
2. Configure XDEBUG section. There are examples for MAC Os & Linux.
3. Create docker network `docker network create local_housfy_redis`
4. Start docker container with `docker-compose up -d
5. Install all dependencies with: `make install`

### 🛑 Important Notice 
There are no provided volumes for Mariadb neither Redis so each time you start
your docker containers you will lose all data.
All make commands related to cs-fixer, composer, migrations, testing (both unit & functional)
as well as the RabbitMQ consumer are run inside docker container so you dont have 
to worry to enter them with docker exec. 

### ✅ Migrations & Tests execution
1. Enter php-fpm container by running the command `docker exec -it officesphp bash`
2. Run migrations with `make migrations`
3. Now exit container and go back to your project folder.
4. Run unit tests with: `make test-unit`. There is coverage provided on: `var/phpunit/html/index.html`
5. Run functional tests with: `make test-functional`
6. Every time you want to make a commit both unit & functional tests and cs-fixer will be triggered via 
a pre-commit hook.

## 👩‍💻 Project explanation

This project tries to replicate a simple office API microservice. It's decoupled from any framework 
(I use PHPSlim only in the UI layer) but it has Simfony libraries such as Doctrine (in order to access its
 powerful ORM) & Console.
